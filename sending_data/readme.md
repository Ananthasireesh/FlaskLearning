It is always better to include all the html pages inside a folder called Templates, to avoid 
hard coding and for better folder structure.

Always name the folder as "templates" since its a flask convention and flask understands it 
can locate all html files under templates 

goto getbootstarp.com and copy starter templete to home.html
